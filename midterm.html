        <p style="color:chocolate; font-family: Arial,Helvetica, sans-serif;">Programers want memory to be fast,large, and cheap as memory Speed often shapes perfornance capacity limits the size of problems that can be solved, and the cost of memory today is often the majority of computer cost .Architects have found that they can address these confiicting demands with a hierarchy of memories, with the fastest, smallest and most experts have memory per bit at the top of the hierarchy and the slowest, largest, and cheapest per bit at the bottom. Caches give the programmer the illusion that main memory is nearly as fast as the top of the hierarchy and nearly as big and cheap as the botto of the hierarchy We use a layered triangle icon represent the menory hierarehy The shape indicates speed, cost, and size: the eloser to the top, the faster and more expensive per bit the memory the wider the base of the layer, the bigger the memory.</p>
